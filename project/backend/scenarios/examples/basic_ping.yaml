  nodes:
    - name: "Host1"
      type: "host"
      ip: "10.0.0.1"
      
    - name: "Host2"
      type: "host"
      ip: "10.0.0.2"
  
  links:
    - from: "Host1"
      to: "Host2"
      delay_ms: 5
      bandwidth_mbps: 100
      packet_loss: 0.0

    action: ping
    params:
      from: "Host2"
      to: "Host1"
    expect:
      success: true
      max_latency_ms: 10

validation:
  - type: "connectivity"
    params:
      from: "Host1"
      to: "Host2"
    threshold:
      success_rate: 1.0
      max_latency_ms: 10

expected_outcome: |
  Both hosts should be able to ping each other successfully.
  Round-trip latency should be approximately 10ms (2 * link delay).
  No packet loss should occur.
